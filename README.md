# MicroWave

MicroWave is a non-commercial stealth-action video game, based on Unreal Engine 4 technology. Feel free to use and modify it.

In the game the player uses MW-gun to breach the guarding system and complete the level. Guards are MOTs (mounted guards) and PATs (patrolling guards). To disable the guards, the player fires the MW-gun at them, interferes their electronics or brings them down. For more detailed description, please visit the game discussion thread.
